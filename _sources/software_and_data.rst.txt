Software and Data
================================

One of the most important objective of the Continual AI project is to provide an easy access to Continual Learning both in terms of didactic materials and open software/datasets for business/research. In this page we will try to collect every open-source project related to Continual Learning.

Software
--------------------------------

- `Continuum CL library <https://github.com/Continvvm/continuum>`_: Continuum is a Python library (written with PyTorch) for Continual Learning. It supports many datasets and most CL scenarios (NC, NI, NIC and others).
- `NORB sequencer <https://github.com/vlomonaco/norb-creator>`_: Java application (with GUI) to make small videos out of the NORB dataset.
- `GEM implementation <https://github.com/facebookresearch/GradientEpisodicMemory>`_: Implementation of the CL strategy “Gradient Episodic Memory”.
- `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_: Open source interface that provides a ready-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks for evaluating performance of your algorithm.
- `DeepMind Lab <https://github.com/deepmind/lab>`_: 3D learning environment that provides a suite of challenging 3D navigation and puzzle-solving tasks for learning agents.
- `DEN <https://github.com/jaehong-yoon93/DEN>`_: TensorFlow implementation of the CL strategy “Dynamically Expandable Networks”.


Datasets and Benchmarks
--------------------------------

- `CORe50 benchmark <https://github.com/vlomonaco/core50>`_: Continual Learning benchmark for object recognition and robotics.
- `OpenLORIS-Object <https://lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/dataset/Data_Object-Recognition.html>`_: A Dataset and Benchmark towards Lifelong Object Recognition
- `Visual Domain Decathlon <https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/decathlon/>`_: Ten image classification problems representative of very different visual domains.
- `iCubWord Transformation <https://robotology.github.io/iCubWorld/#icubworld-transformations-modal>`_: a Dataset for Continual Learning and Robotics.
- `Omniglot <https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot>`_: A dataset for few shot, meta-learning and continual learning.
- `NICO <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8mouawi5guaupyb/AAD4fdySrA6fn3PgSmhKwFgva>`_: Towards Non-i.i.d. Image Classification.
