# Join us!

**ContinualAI** is non-profit research organization and an open community of Continual/Lifelong Learning researchers and enthusiasts started in January 2018 by [Vincenzo Lomonaco](http://vincenzolomonaco.com/) and made possible with the early contribution of [Keiland Cooper](http://kwcooper.xyz/).

We are always looking for new people to join the ContinualAI effort to build open source projects.
