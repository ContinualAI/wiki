The aim of the project is to create an open-source, collaborative wiki to provide a starting point for researchers, developers and AI enthusiasts who share an interest in Continual Learning and are willing to learn more or contribute to this field.  
You can find info about CL workshops, media articles, companies using CL and much more.  

The wiki also provides a link to a curated list of [annotated papers](https://www.continualai.org/papers/). Be sure to check it out!

[Join our community](https://continualai.herokuapp.com/) on Slack to stay updated with the latest Continual Learning news.

Below, you can find instructions on **how to contribute to the wiki**!


---------------------------------------------------

## Add a new paper to the Research section
ContinualAI a [curated list of CL papers](https://wiki.continualai.org/research.html). The list is maintained through a Zotero group. You can join the group and help us keeping it updated (see next section).  

If you don't want to join the group, you can simply open a Github issue to suggest us a new paper (or even more than one). We will take care of adding it to the wiki as soon as possible. 

1. Open a new Github issue. You can use `new paper` or `new conference` tags to specify which kind of issue you are submitting.

2. Attach your bib file containing the paper you want to include in the wiki. If you don't have a bib file, just provide us with the link to the paper. The link should point to a location where paper metadata can be appropriately retrieved by common reference managers.


## Join the ContinualAI Zotero group

You can give your contribution to the group by **adding new papers** or by helping **annotating the existing ones**.

1. Join our [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2623909/continual_learning_papers/)

2. To **add a new paper**

	2.1. Add it to the group folder which best represents the paper contribution. Read some advices below if you are uncertain on this. You can add the paper from your library or directly from the paper webpage through the Zotero web browser plugin. 
    
    2.2 Make sure that at least `title`, `authors`, `item type` and `publication` are specified. The `year` must be put inside `date` field.
    
    2.3 Also put a link to the paper in the `url` field. 

3. To **annotate** an existing paper

	3.1. Check the list of existing tags in `tags.csv` file. If you want to add a new tag, please add it in there and submit a Pull Request (see `Contribute to the wiki` section).

	3.2. Add your tags in the `Tags` tab of Zotero. Please, remember to write the tag in square brackets e.g. `[mytag]`

	3.3. Add your notes in the `Notes` tab of Zotero.

Wiki admins will periodically export the bibtex to keep the list updated. In case we forgot, join the [ContinualAI Slack](https://continualai.herokuapp.com/) and complain about our behavior in the `#wiki` channel.

#### Advices to add new papers in Zotero

* Check if the paper already exist by using the `Citation Key` or the title in Zotero search bar.

* Don't forget to add the publication venue (Journal, Proceedings...). Use `publication = arXiv` if the paper is a preprint.

* CLAI Wiki uses a system based on categories. This can sometimes be limiting. In general, please consider to add the paper in the category which you consider the most relevant one. You can add the paper in at most **2** categories, if you believe that both are equally relevant.

* Please, do not add new tags if a similar category already exists.

## Contribute to the wiki - TO BE UPDATED WITH THE NEW WIKI INFO
Adding new papers is not the only way for you to contribute. Adding new companies, workshops or other information is very easy!
